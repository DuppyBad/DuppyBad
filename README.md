I'm Duppy(also known as _Kyrios_ in some corners of the internet). I am very
interested in how the magic of modern machinery functions, and to that end, I
study Cybersecurity at University in order to break (and consequently secure)
many different forms of computers. Outside of my studies, my hobbies focus
mainly on competing in CTFs, teaching others, and learning all I can about the
fields of my interest.

Said fields include:

- Virtualisation
- System Adminstration
- Cryptography (Set Theory & Discrete Mathematics)
- Lambda Calculus & Functional Programming
- Infrastructure Hosting

Languages(Ranked in ability from top to bottom):

- Python
- Rust
- C#
- Typescript
- Nix
- C
- C++
- Go
- Haskell

Tooling I use frequently:

- Linux(NixOS)
- Docker
